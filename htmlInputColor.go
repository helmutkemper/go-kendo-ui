// <input> elements of type "color" provide a user interface element that lets a user specify a color, either by using a
// visual color picker interface or by entering the color into a text field in "#rrggbb" hexadecimal format. Only simple
// colors (with no alpha channel) are allowed.
//
// The element's presentation may vary substantially from one browser and/or platform to another â€” it might be a simple
// textual input that automatically validates to ensure that the color information is entered in the proper format, or a
// platform-standard color picker, or some kind of custom color picker window.

  The form element that the input element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an id
  of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, this <input> element must be a
  descendant of a <form> element. This attribute enables you to place <input> elements anywhere within a document, not
  just as descendants of their form elements. An input can only be associated with one form.

  This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. In particular, the click
  event will not be dispatched on disabled controls. Also, a disabled control's value isn't submitted with the form.
  Unlike other browsers, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use
  the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.
